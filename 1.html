                <p>FogCam sprang to life in 1994 as a student project in the <a href="https://elsit.sfsu.edu/content/instructional-technologies-ma">Department of Instructional 
                    Technologies</a> at <a href="http://www.sfsu.edu/">San Francisco State University</a>. Fogcam! is the oldest continuously operating webcam in the world.</p>
                <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webcam">Wikipedia confirms we are the oldest operating webcam</a>. You can even see FogCam on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_websites_founded_before_1995#1994">Wikipedia's list of oldest websites</a>.</p>
                <p>We've slightly changed campus locations a few times as necessary over the years, to prevent being shut down by the university.</p>

                    <p>Historically, the first webcam actually predated the web. The <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-20439301"> Trojan Room coffee pot cam</a> at the University of Cambridge came online way back in 1991. It was retired in 2001.</p>
